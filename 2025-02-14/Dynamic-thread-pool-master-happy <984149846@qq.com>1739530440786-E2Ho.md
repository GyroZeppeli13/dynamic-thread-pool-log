The provided `git diff` record shows changes across multiple files in a project that seems to be a dynamic thread pool implementation for Spring Boot. Here's a review of the changes:

**pom.xml (Root)**
- The project version has been changed from `1.0-SNAPSHOT` to `1.0`, indicating a move from a snapshot version to a release version.
- A new module `dynamic-thread-pool-test` has been added to the project.

**dynamic-thread-pool-spring-boot-starter/pom.xml**
- The version of the project has been updated from `1.0-SNAPSHOT` to `1.0`.
- The `maven-surefire-plugin` configuration has been changed to skip tests, which might not be ideal for a release version.
- The `maven-compiler-plugin` version has been updated and the source/target compatibility has been explicitly set to Java 1.8.
- The order of plugin configurations has been changed, which doesn't impact functionality but might affect readability.

**dynamic-thread-pool-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/cn/happy/middleware/dynamic/thread/pool/sdk/config/DynamicThreadPoolAutoConfig.java**
- The class is now annotated with `@Configuration` and `@EnableScheduling`, indicating it's a Spring configuration class that enables scheduling.
- A new `DynamicThreadPoolService` bean has been added, which suggests the addition of a service to manage dynamic thread pools.
- The configuration now retrieves the application name and sets up thread pool configurations based on cached data.

**dynamic-thread-pool-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/cn/happy/middleware/dynamic/thread/pool/sdk/domain/DynamicThreadPoolService.java**
- A new class `DynamicThreadPoolService` has been added, which implements `IDynamicThreadPoolService`.
- This service provides methods to query and update thread pool configurations.

**dynamic-thread-pool-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/cn/happy/middleware/dynamic/thread/pool/sdk/domain/IDynamicThreadPoolService.java**
- A new interface `IDynamicThreadPoolService` has been added, defining methods for querying and updating thread pool configurations.

**dynamic-thread-pool-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/cn/happy/middleware/dynamic/thread/pool/sdk/domain/model/entity/ThreadPoolConfigEntity.java**
- A new class `ThreadPoolConfigEntity` has been added, which seems to be a data structure for holding thread pool configuration details.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/pom.xml**
- A new `pom.xml` file for the `dynamic-thread-pool-test` module has been added, indicating a separate module for testing the dynamic thread pool functionality.
- Dependencies for Spring Boot, testing, configuration processing, and Fastjson have been added.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/src/main/java/cn/happy/Application.java**
- A new Spring Boot application class has been added with an `ApplicationRunner` that submits tasks to a thread pool with random delays and execution times.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/src/main/java/cn/happy/config/ThreadPoolConfig.java**
- A new configuration class `ThreadPoolConfig` has been added, which defines two `ThreadPoolExecutor` beans with configurable properties.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/src/main/java/cn/happy/config/ThreadPoolConfigProperties.java**
- A new configuration properties class `ThreadPoolConfigProperties` has been added, which holds properties for thread pool configuration.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/src/main/resources/application-*.yml**
- New YAML configuration files for development, production, and test environments have been added, specifying server port, thread pool configuration, and logging levels.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml**
- A new Logback configuration file has been added, defining log output formats, file rolling policies, and asynchronous logging behavior.

**dynamic-thread-pool-test/src/test/java/cn/happy/test/ApiTest.java**
- A new test class `ApiTest` has been added, which is currently empty but could be used for testing the application.

**Overall Impression:**
The changes indicate a significant update to the project, with the addition of a test module, improved configuration management, and a service to dynamically manage thread pools. The code seems to be well-structured, and the use of Spring annotations and configuration properties aligns with best practices for Spring Boot applications.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure that tests are comprehensive and cover the new functionality added in this release.
- Consider using a more recent version of Java if compatibility allows, as Java 1.8 is quite old.
- Review the decision to skip tests in the `maven-surefire-plugin` configuration, as it's generally not recommended for release versions.
- Document the new features and configuration options for users of the dynamic thread pool.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the application, especially in the new dynamic thread pool management service.
